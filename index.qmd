**mlsquare** is an open source, deep tech, initative to democratise ML. The fundamental tenet is, using ML to make ML useful. 

## Past ML software projects

*   [mlsquare]((https://github.com/mlsquare/mlsquare)): make ML interoperable [paper]

## WIP ML software projects
* [FedEm](https://github.com/mlsquare/fedem): a framework for decentralise the development of LLMs

## Upcoming ML software projects

* *neural tokenizers* to enable the extension of English-centric LLMs to other languages

* *model grafting* via analytical and numerical approximations to enable efficient cross-architecture transfer learning

* *compute & data efficient training* via layer-by-layer and block-by-block LLM training, which is inherently embarassingly parallel, and with potential analytcal update rules (no need for backprop and gradients)

* *deep kernel machines* a framework for composing many transformer-like architectures with specifiable inductive biases

* *xKANs * a framework for composing many [KAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756)-like architectures with specifiable non-parametric function approximators like cubic B-splines, Chebyshev polynomials, Wavelets, etc..

## Upcoming Courses

* *MLOps - from theory to practive* for upper level undergraduate students

* *Theory of Deep Learning: Why it works, a construcionist approach* for upper level undergraduate students
